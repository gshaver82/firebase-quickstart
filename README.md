# quickstart starter code
this uses react with firebase authentication for google and email (more can be added). 

# current status
currently working, but not yet polished.

lots of old css code copy pasted over from another project that hasnt been sanitized. 
readme not organized


# Step by step install instructions
heroku config vars
NODE_ENV
production

create new firebase project card

click gear and go to project settings and add firebase to your webapp ( the "</>" icon)

click gear and go to project settings > general settings

Firebase SDK snippet click CDN snippet 

copy unique API KEY codes etc over to service account key

click gear and go to project settings >> service accounts>> generate new private key
put that info into service acount key


put firebase database URL routes index if needed. 
 "databaseURL": "",

when setting up firebase auth
authentication >> get started
authentication >> sign in method

and enable google 

add deployed website URL to authorized domains (example, full heroku website URL)

------------------

heroku settings 
add config vars for heroku authentication deployment


NODE_ENV
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY

find and replace \n with nothing
recommend to copy and paste the key to a file thats in use, do the find and replace and 
DELETE the copied key. you will expose the key if not and its a bit of a pain to fix

FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID is project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL is client_email
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID is appId
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN is authDomain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY is apiKey
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID is project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID is messagingSenderId
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET is storageBucket

add buildpacks
heroku settings 
https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git
click button for 
heroku/nodejs

have node.js below react buildpack (unsure if this matters)

possible problems and solutions

problem 1
ls: cannot access '/app/build/static/js/*.js': No such file or directory
2021-04-13T07:17:05.025894+00:00 app[web.1]: Error injecting runtime env: bundle not found '/app/build/static/js/*.js'. See: https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack/blob/master/README.md#user-content-custom-bundle-location

solution 1
entered in ALL config vars, uncommented service account in routes index, adjusted package json, reordered buildpacks order to have nodes buildpack AFTER react buildpack. 

--------------
fill out .env file

## Firebase
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN=""
-------
the below one line is optional if you have a firebase database or not
------
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=""

--------------------
add sign in methods on firebase console under authentication > sign in method.

google, email/password etc

for facebook
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web
look here and for a facebook developer account
not currently implemented in this quickstart

----------------
If global credentials are accidentaly exposed 
(for example, uploaded to github without gitignore blocking the upload)
then you will get angry emails from google letting you know that the key was exposed
you will be asked to correct the problem AND change keys.

first, correct the gitignore to exclude serviceAccountKey.json or find where the key is that is being uploaded and correct that. 

then go to firebase console > gear top left > project settings > service accounts > 
manage service account permissions

find compromised key > click the dot dot dot and manage keys and add a key. 
this should download a new json. copy that to to the service account key json. 

----------------

adding mongoose db

do stuff in here
https://www.mongodb.com/cloud


 the line below goes into MONGODB_URI config vars

mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@atlascluster.5pnpg.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Replace <password> with the password for the <username> user. Replace myFirstDatabase with the name of the database that connections will use by default. Ensure any option params are URL encoded.

uncomment out mongo lines. setup local mongo db if desired
